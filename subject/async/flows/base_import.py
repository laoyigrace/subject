        # docs for more info). The motivation behind this is also explained in
        # the `_ImportToFS.execute` method.
        #
        # Due to the fact that we have an `_ImportToFS` task which downloads
        # the subject data already, we need to be as smart as we can in this task
        # to avoid downloading the data several times and reducing the copy or
        # write times. There are several scenarios where the interaction
        # between this task and `_ImportToFS` could be improved. All these
        # scenarios assume the `_ImportToFS` task has been executed before
        # and/or in a more abstract scenario, that `file_path` is being
        # provided.
        #
        # Scenario 1: FS Store is Remote, introspection enabled,
        # conversion disabled
        #
        # In this scenario, the user would benefit from having the scratch path
        # being the same path as the fs store. Only one write would happen and
        # an extra read will happen in order to introspect the subject. Note that
        # this read is just for the subject headers and not the entire file.
        #
        # Scenario 2: FS Store is remote, introspection enabled,
        # conversion enabled
        #
        # In this scenario, the user would benefit from having a *local* store
        # into which the subject can be converted. This will require downloading
        # the subject locally, converting it and then copying the converted subject
        # to the remote store.
        #
        # Scenario 3: FS Store is local, introspection enabled,
        # conversion disabled
        # Scenario 4: FS Store is local, introspection enabled,
        # conversion enabled

        # benefit, about the scratch path and the FS store being the
        # same from a performance perspective. Space wise, regardless
        # of the scenario, the user will have to account for it in
