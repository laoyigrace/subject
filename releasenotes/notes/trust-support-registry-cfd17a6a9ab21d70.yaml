features:
  - Implemented re-authentication with trusts when updating subject status in
    registry after subject upload. When long-running subject upload takes some a lot
    of time (more than token expiration time) subject uses trusts to receive new
    token and update subject status in registry. It allows users to upload big
    size subjects without increasing token expiration time.
