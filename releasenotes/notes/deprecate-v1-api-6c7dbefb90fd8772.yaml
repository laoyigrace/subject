  - The Subjects (Glance) version 1 API has been DEPRECATED.
    Please see deprecations section for more information.

deprecations:
  - With the deprecation of the Subjects (Glance) version 1
    API in the Newton release, it is subject to removal on
    or after the Pike release. The configuration options
    specific to the Subjects (Glance) v1 API have also been
    deprecated and are subject to removal. An indirectly related
    configuration option enable_v2_api has been deprecated too
    as it becomes redundant once the Subjects (Glance) v1 API is
    removed. Appropriate warning messages have been setup for
    the deprecated configuration options and when the Subjects
    (Glance) v1 API is enabled (being used). Operators are
    advised to deploy the Subjects (Glance) v2 API. The standard
    OpenStack deprecation policy will be followed for the
    removals.
